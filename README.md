# Network Checker
> *What's up with my WiFi?*

Network Checker detects network problems with a low amount of friction.
## Why?
I had no WiFi days ago, and I did not get to write code and post it to a Git host called GitHub
(where you are already). I spent a few days creating this program, by taking code from my Wayback Machine
command line, [`wayback`](https://github.com/Tyler887/wayback).
